# stack-convert
stackconvert is a CLI tool to convert perf record stacks to a JSON hierarchical data structure that can be consumed by [d3-flame-graph](https://github.com/spiermar/d3-flame-graph).

## Getting Started

stackconvert is available from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and can be installed using the following command.

```
$ npm install stack-convert -g
```

Once the tool is installed, it can be used in the CLI.

```
$ stackconvert perf.data > perf.json
```

Where:

```
perf.data is the output file from perf record you want to convert
```

## Features

### Collapsed/Folded Stacks

The tool can also be used with collapsed/folded stacks generated by @brendangregg, [stackcollapse-perf.pl](https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph/blob/master/stackcollapse-perf.pl) script.

```
$ stackconvert --folded perf.data-folded > perf.json
```

### Live Flame Graphs

The tool can be used to generate input for live flame graphs by adding a time dimension to the output. In this case, the input file must be the multiline perf record output, not the folded/collapsed stacks, since those do not contain timestamps.

```
$ stackconvert --live perf.data > perf.json
```

## Examples

Input and Output examples can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/spiermar/node-stack-convert/tree/master/examples) directory.
